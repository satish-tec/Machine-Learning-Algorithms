📖 #Overview of Learning Algorithms

This repository includes implementations of foundational concept learning algorithms used in hypothesis learning: Find-S, List-Then-Eliminate, and Candidate Elimination.

🔹 #Find-S Algorithm

The Find-S Algorithm is a simple approach used for learning the most specific hypothesis that is consistent with the given training examples. It assumes that:

The hypothesis space is represented in a conjunctive form.

There is at least one positive example.

No inconsistent training data is present.

Logic:

Initialize the most specific hypothesis (h) as the most restrictive set of conditions.

Iterate through each positive training example:

If an attribute in h does not match the example, generalize it.

Ignore negative examples (they are not used in updating h).

The final hypothesis represents the most specific concept description.

Limitations:

Cannot handle noisy data.

Does not account for negative examples.

Cannot learn disjunctive hypotheses.

🔹 #List-Then-Eliminate Algorithm

The List-Then-Eliminate Algorithm is a brute-force approach to concept learning, which maintains a list of all possible hypotheses and eliminates those inconsistent with the training data.

Logic:

Initialize the version space with all possible hypotheses.

For each training example:

Remove hypotheses that are inconsistent with the example.

Continue until all examples have been processed.

The remaining hypotheses represent the possible concept descriptions.

Limitations:

Computationally expensive as it starts with a large hypothesis space.

Inefficient for large hypothesis spaces.

Does not generalize well to large datasets.

🔹 #Candidate Elimination Algorithm

The Candidate Elimination Algorithm is a more refined approach than Find-S and List-Then-Eliminate. It maintains both a specific boundary (S) and a general boundary (G) to refine the version space.

Logic:

Initialize S as the most specific hypothesis and G as the most general hypothesis.

For each training example:

If positive: Generalize S minimally to be consistent while keeping it within G.

If negative: Specialize G minimally to exclude the negative instance.

Continue until no further changes can be made.

The final version space consists of hypotheses that fit all examples.

Advantages:

More expressive than Find-S.

Can learn from both positive and negative examples.

Maintains a range of possible hypotheses, allowing for better generalization.

Limitations:

Computationally expensive for large hypothesis spaces.

Sensitive to noise in the training data.

Requires a well-defined hypothesis representation.
